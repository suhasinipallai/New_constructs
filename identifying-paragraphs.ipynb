The   share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend   on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan   activity, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions, stock price and legal and   regulatory requirements. In September 2016, the Board of Directors approved a plan which authorized the   repurchase of up to an additional 30.0 million shares of the Company's common stock. As of January 31, 2018,   10.4 million shares have been repurchased under this plan.

Stock Repurchase Program   The Company's Board of Directors (Board) previously approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the   Company was authorized to purchase up to $500.0 million of its common stock, and has periodically replenished   the stock repurchase program to such amount. The Board replenished the stock repurchase program up to $500.0   million on June 15, 2017. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of   common stock, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company's Chief Financial   Officer or the Board. The Company repurchases shares to offset dilution caused by ongoing stock issuances   from existing equity plans for equity compensation awards and issuances related to acquisitions, and when   management believes it is a good use of cash. Repurchases are transacted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of   the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and may be made through any means   including, but not limited to, open market purchases, plans executed under Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act   and structured transactions.

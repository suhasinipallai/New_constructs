The Company\\'s core industrial gases business provides atmospheric and process\\ngases and related equipment to manufacturing markets, including refining and petrochemical, metals,\\nelectronics, and food and beverage. Air Products is also the world\\'s leading supplier of liquefied natural gas\\nprocess technology and equipment. With operations in 50 countries, in 2017\\nwe had sales of $8.2 billion, total company\\nassets, including assets of both continuing and discontinued operations, of $18.5\\nbillion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 15,300 full- and part-time employees from continuing and discontinued\\noperations.\\nAs of 30 September 2017,\\nour operations were organized into five reportable business segments: Industrial Gases - Americas; Industrial\\nGases - EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa); Industrial Gases - Asia; Industrial Gases - Global; and\\nCorporate and other. The financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on these\\noperations. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic\\nInformation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business\\nsegments.\\n\\n2017 IN SUMMARY\\nIn 2017, we were able to\\nfocus on our core industrial gases business by completing the separation of EMD through the spin-off of Versum\\nMaterials, Inc. (Versum) and the sale of PMD to Evonik Industries AG (Evonik). Sales of $8.2 billion increased\\nnine percent over the prior year, primarily due to volume growth from new project onstreams across our regional\\nindustrial gases businesses, underlying growth in the base business, and continued progress on the Jazan\\nproject within our Industrial Gases - Global segment, partially offset by weaker liquefied natural gas (LNG)\\nequipment sales. We delivered operating margin of 17.4%,\\nadjusted operating margin of 21.6%, and adjusted EBITDA\\nmargin of 34.1% as our productivity actions were offset by\\nthe impact of energy cost pass-through to customers. Diluted EPS of $5.16\\nincreased 2% from the prior year. On a\\nnon-GAAP basis, adjusted diluted EPS of $6.31 increased 12%.\\nHighlights for 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nâ€¢\\n\\n\\nSales of $8,187.6 increased 9%, or $683.9\\nas underlying sales growth of 7% and higher\\nenergy and natural gas cost passâ€‘through to customers of 3% were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 1%. Underlying sales increased primarily from higher volumes across the industrial gases businesses,\\nincluding the Jazan project, partially offset by lower LNG sales in the corporate and other\\nsegment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nâ€¢\\n\\n\\nOperating income of $1,427.6 decreased 7%, or $102.1, primarily due to a noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment\\ncharge and higher cost reduction and asset actions, partially offset by favorable volumes and lower other\\ncosts. Operating margin of 17.4% decreased\\n300 bp. On a nonâ€‘GAAP basis, adjusted operating income of\\n$1,769.6 increased 9%, or $149.7, and adjusted operating margin of\\n21.6% was flat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nâ€¢\\n\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA of $2,795.0 increased 7%, or\\n$173.5. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.1% decreased\\n80 bp and was negatively impacted by 90 bp from higher\\ncontractual energy pass-through to customers. Excluding this impact, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 10\\nbp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nâ€¢\\n\\n\\nIncome from continuing operations of $1,134.4 increased 3%,\\nor $34.9, and diluted EPS of $5.16 increased 2%, or\\n$.12. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted income from continuing\\noperations of $1,385.9 increased 13%, or $155.6, and adjusted\\ndiluted EPS of $6.31 increased 12%, or $.67.

Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at October 29, 2017, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied's ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied's credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied's access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied's obligations.

However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.5 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor's and Prime-1 (\"P-1\") by Moody's, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreements and available borrowings under our $9.5 billion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.

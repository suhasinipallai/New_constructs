      "Since March 2000, our Board has  approved a repurchase program authorizing  repurchases of up to 555  million   shares of  our  common stock.  The  repurchase program  is  effected primarily  through  regular  open-market   purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1), the amounts and timing of   which are  determined  primarily by  our  current and  projected  capital position,  but  which may  also  be   influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock. The   repurchase program has no  set expiration or termination  date. Prior to repurchasing  common stock, we  must   receive confirmation that the FRB does not object to such capital action\n",

      "Common Stock Repurchases   On September 18, 2013,  the Board of  Directors approved our  common stock repurchase  program.

On February 2,  2017, the Board of  Directors approved a further  increase in that authorization  to   $2.1 billion. This program expires on  December 31, 2019. We intend to  repurchase shares of common stock  in   open market transactions  in order  to offset new  shares issued  under equity compensation  programs and  to   provide for additional  shareholder returns.  During 2017,  we repurchased  12,755,547 shares  at an  average   price, including  commissions,  of $31.37  per  share, or  $400  million in  the  aggregate.
